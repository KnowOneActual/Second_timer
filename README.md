[![Made with Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

This is a simple Python command-line application that acts as a countdown timer. It prompts the user to input a desired number of seconds, then counts down in real-time, displaying the remaining seconds. Once the timer reaches zero, it indicates that time is up.

## How to Use

To run this application, you'll need Python installed on your system.

1.  **Save the file:**
    Save the provided `timer.py` file to your local machine.

2.  **Run from your terminal:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved `timer.py`, and run the script using the Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python timer.py
    ```

3.  **Enter countdown duration:**
    The application will then ask you to enter the number of seconds you wish to count down from:

    ```
    How many seconds do you want to count down from?
    ```
    Enter your desired number (e.g., `10`) and press Enter.
